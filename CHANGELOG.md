2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validation
3. **Documentation**: Update README and examples
4. **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning
5. **Release**: Tag and publish to PyPI

## Migration Guide

### From Manual Analysis to GetSiteDNA

**Before GetSiteDNA:**
```bash
# Manual process
1. Manually browse website
2. Take screenshots
3. Extract colors manually
4. Document components by hand
5. Write specifications manually
```

**With GetSiteDNA:**
```bash
# Automated process
getsitedna analyze https://example.com --interactive
# Complete analysis with specifications generated automatically
```

### Configuration Migration

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Old approach: Manual configuration
export CRAWLER_DELAY=1
export MAX_PAGES=50

# New approach: GetSiteDNA configuration
export GETSITEDNA_MAX_WORKERS=4
export GETSITEDNA_CACHE_ENABLED=true
```

## Support and Compatibility

### Python Versions
- Python 3.8+
- Full async/await support
- Type hints throughout

### Operating Systems
- macOS
- Linux
- Windows (with some limitations on Playwright)

### Browser Support
- Chromium (default)
- Firefox
- WebKit

### Dependencies
- Core: Click, Pydantic, aiohttp, BeautifulSoup4
- Dynamic: Playwright
- Performance: psutil, aiofiles
- Output: Rich console, Pillow for images
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio

## Breaking Changes

### Future Considerations
- Configuration file format may evolve
- API interfaces may change before 1.0.0
- Output schema updates for enhanced features
